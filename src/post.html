    <h1>Don’t Build a Startup, Build a Movement</h1>
    <h2>How to move the masses by going beyond selling just software</h2>
    <p>As a startup marketer, spending my lunch break arguing with developers is not my favorite part of the job.</p>
    <p>“That’s bullshit,” our CTO replies. “MailChimp’s product isn’t any better than the rest; it’s just another tool
        to send your newsletters. Why spend $200/month when their competitors offer the same thing for a few bucks?”</p>
    <p>I want to convince him that MailChimp ensures our email campaigns hit customers’ inboxes, not their spam
        folders.</p>
    <p>But he keeps beating me back with technical explanations I don’t fully get.</p>
    <p>“Look, we can even build our own email bot that does the exact same thing,” he adds. “You’re just sold on their
        brand.”</p>
    <p>Well, he’s partly right.</p>p><p>Over the last years, MailChimp has built an iconic brand with its design-centric
        approach and unconventional marketing campaigns.</p>
    <p>Monkey mascot billboards with no mention of their name … “MailKimp” and other name-teasing campaigns that reached
        334 million people … design-centric annual reports that came with style …</p>
    <p>MailChimp’s giveaways were unconventional, too. Free monkey hats for cats were delighting their superfans like me
        who were ready to pay more.</p>
    <p>In a world where anyone can copy your product overnight, instead of knitting monkey hats for cats, MailChimp
        could very well have chosen to get into an arms race on building more features.</p>
    <p>After all, the company was even receiving open letters and warnings from some big customers threatening to shift
        to the competition if they didn’t build more advanced features.</p>
    <p>MailChimp’s answer?</p>
    <blockquote>Focus on building a brand customers love.</blockquote>
    <p>As we near the end of 2017, the email startup that never took a single dime in outside funding is preparing to
        close the year with a mind-blowing 15 million customers.</p>
    <p>But enough with the monkey business.</p>
    <p>Let’s look at the big picture to understand what this means for startups trying to succeed in today’s cluttered
        world:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>You don’t have to disrupt an entire industry: While many entrepreneurs are busy trying to build the next
            Uber or Facebook, this is a myth we need to dispel. MailChimp didn’t disrupt any industry, yet it managed to
            build its monkey empire in a market that was becoming increasingly crowded.
        </li>
        <li>If you aren’t disrupting or creating an entirely new market, you can still build an empire in a highly
            competitive space: And it involves growing superfans who religiously follow your movement and spread the
            word about you even if you charge premium prices or refuse to get into an arms race on building more
            features.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>What is the secret, though?</p>
    <p>How do you reach the masses and grow your fan club that enables you to play the game by your own rules, without
        worrying about the competition?</p>
    <p><strong>The options vary, but some of the world’s most successful startups use two powerful strategies:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>First is obviously the “MailChimp way”, i.e., marketing your product like a high-quality brand. As their founder
        Ben Chestnut explains:</p>
    <blockquote>“We make apps for business customers, using low-priced parts, then we market the apps like a
        high-quality, design-centric, lovable B2C brand.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>But a growing breed of thriving startups uses an alternative strategy — one that doesn’t necessarily require a
        design-centric approach.</p>
    <p>It requires influencing people’s thinking instead:</p>
    <h3>Don’t disrupt an industry, disrupt the thinking</h3>
    <p>As Mark Bonchek highlights in his widely popular Harvard essay:</p>
    <blockquote>“Companies that successfully market and sell innovation are able to shift how people think not only
        about their product, but about themselves, the market, and the world.<br><br>Don’t sell a product, sell a whole
        new way of thinking.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>Take Drift, one of the rising stars in the tech scene today.</p>
    <p>Instead of forcing their product down people’s throats, the “movers” like Drift sell the underlying shift in
        thinking, the original insight that led to their innovation.</p>
    <p>In Drift’s case, the original insight that led to their product was the old, broken way of marketing and sales
        that still relied on website forms and annoying sales follow-ups.</p>
    <p>Thats why, instead of hard selling or flooding their blog with product info, they talk about how today’s
        marketing and sales techniques are so yesterday, or why marketing automation and email marketing are broken.</p>
    <blockquote>“This is different than your value proposition. It’s an assumption (usually unconscious) about how the
        world works,” adds Bonchek.
    </blockquote>
    <p>The logic is easy to apply to any startup when you think of it as a template:</p>
    <blockquote>We champion [insert], and shift the way people think about [insert] to [insert].</blockquote>
    <p>For instance, Drift champions the new way of marketing and sales, and shifts the way people think about marketing
        and sales to be more conversation-driven, personalized, and human.</p>
    <p>Two other iconic companies — Basecamp and Salesforce — are also leading the way in rethinking existing mental
        models.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Basecamp’s founders grow their superfans by championing the “Un-Silicon Valley way” and shifting how people
            think about management, productivity, time, growth, or the way startups work.
        </li>
        <li>Salesforce champions the “no software” mantra and shifts the thinking from packaged, installed software to
            cloud computing and software-as-a-service.
        </li>
    </ul>
